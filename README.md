# Revue â€” a distributed real-time system for video surveillance

## Introduction

Revue is a distributed real-time system that allows users to monitor an environment through
devices capable of capturing environment data (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure) and video streams.

Revue can interact with Web of Things (WoT) devices that adhere to the APIs provided by the system (documented in
the [docs/api](docs/api) directory).
An example of a WoT device that adheres to the Revue APIs is provided in
the [revue-sample-thing](https://github.com/revue-org/revue-sample-thing) repository.

### Machine Learning

[![YOLO](https://img.shields.io/badge/YOLO-00FFFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=darkreader&logoColor=black)](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docker.com) (for development mode)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
  and [Helm](https://helm.sh/) (for production mode)

## Getting Started

- Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/Mala1180/revue/releases)
- Unzip the archive
- Modify the `.env` file to fit your needs, e.g., the ports and the credentials to be used (the default ones should be
  fine)

**N.B. The following commands need to be run in the root directory of the project**

### Running with Docker Compose

You can start the whole system by running

```bash
./deploy.sh --docker
```

and stop it by running

```bash
./undeploy.sh --docker
```

### Going to Production

You can deploy the system on a Kubernetes cluster by running

```bash
./deploy.sh --k8s --driver=<driver>
```

where `<driver>` is the driver to be used by Minikube (e.g., `docker`, `qemu`, `virtualbox`, etc.).
See the [Minikube documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/) for more information.

Note that to make the `LoadBalancer` work, the `deploy.sh` script will run the `minikube tunnel` command that requires root
privileges. It is also required to keep the terminal open to keep the tunneling active.

To stop the system, you have to interrupt the tunneling process and then run

```bash
./undeploy.sh --k8s
```

## Interacting with the system

### Web interfaces

- **Revue Web Interface**: The interface through which you can interact with the
  system ([https://frontend.localhost](https://frontend.localhost) or [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080))
    - The default credentials for the login are `user` and `user` (editable
      in [auth/db/auth-init.js](auth/db/auth-init.js)
      file).
- **API Gateway**: Traefik dashboard ([https://localhost:8081](https://localhost:8081))
- **Kafka UI**: The interface to monitor the Kafka topics, messages and
  consumers ([https://localhost:8082](https://localhost:8082))
    - In production mode, you have to access it by running `minikube service kafka-ui`
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: The interfaces to monitor the system **(only in production mode)**
    - Prometheus Server dashboard: accessible by running `minikube service prometheus-server`
    - Grafana dashboard: accessible by running `minikube service grafana`
        - Credentials:
            - Username: _admin_
            - Password: Get the password by
              running `kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo`
        - Configuring Data Source:
            - _Connections > Add new connection > Prometheus > Add new data source_
            - Insert as Prometheus server URL `http://<CLUSTER-IP>:80`. You can get the prometheus-server CLUSTER-IP by
              running `kubectl get services`
            - Click on Save & Test and proceed to the _Dashboard_ section (there are some pre-configured dashboards).

### Monitoring with devices (WoT)

Go to the [revue-sample-thing](https://github.com/revue-org/revue-sample-thing) repository and follow the instructions in the README to set up your own WoT device.
Once the device is up and running, you can add it to the system through the Revue Web Interface.

- Go to [https://frontend.localhost](https://frontend.localhost) and log in
- Go to the _Devices_ section
- Click on the _Add Device_ button
- Fill in the form with the device URL (`localhost` if it is running on the same machine as the system) and test the connection. If the connection is successful, it will retrieve automatically the device capabilities.
- Monitor the device data through the various sections depending on the device capabilities.
